# FancyTable
Android library to implement two-direction scrollable table with `adjustable number of docked/fixed columns and rows` and/or with one-column rows that fill the width of parent which makes it look like `multiple sub-tables with headers` inside the main table.

The library is written based on [TableFixHeaders](https://github.com/InQBarna/TableFixHeaders)
